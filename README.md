# 🧬 nf-genetic-correlations

**Nextflow pipeline for global and regional genetic correlations using GWAS summary statistics**  
Supports **LDSC** for genome-wide correlations and **LAVA** for local (regional) genetic correlations.

---

## 📖 Overview

This pipeline processes **harmonized GWAS summary statistics** (restricted to **European ancestry** for now) and computes:

- **Global genetic correlations** using [LDSC](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc)  
- **Local genetic correlations** using [LAVA](https://github.com/josefin-werme/LAVA)

It will also compute the SNP-based heritability for each of the GWAS summary statistics. For LAVA, it will perform the univariate test for each trait across all loci, and will compute the local genetic correlations (i.e., bivariate test) for pairs of traits which univariate test is significant (0.05/number of loci tested).

There are several advantages of using the pipeline:
1) Given that it uses an LDSC .sif image, there is no need to load old python versions to run LDSC.
2) The pipeline formats and adapts the GWAS summary statistics for each tool.
3) The user does not need to prepare additional files to run LAVA (e.g., sample overlap file or info file).
4) It partitions LAVA loci so that they run in parallel, which significantly reduces the running time.
5) It is reproducible and the user can easily re-run the analysis by adding/removing GWAS datasets from the metadata file.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ape4fld/nf-genetic-correlations.git
cd nf-genetic-correlations
```

### 2. Dependencies

Some R packages need to be pre-installed in R version 4.3.1:

- Tidyverse: dplyr, tidyr, stringr, readr
- Others: here, data.table
- LAVA (```R via remotes::install_github()```)

In Alliance Canada, you can follow these steps:

```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 r/4.3.1
mkdir -p ~/.local/R/$EBVERSIONR/
export R_LIBS=~/.local/R/$EBVERSIONR/
R -e 'install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "stringr", "readr", "here", "data.table"), repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
R -e 'remotes::install_github("josefin-werme/LAVA")'
```

### 3. Inputs Required

---

#### 📁 a) GWAS Summary Statistics

- Accepted formats: `.tsv`, `.csv`, `.txt`, etc.
- Required columns (**names must match exactly**, order can vary and other columns will be ignored):
variant_id, effect_allele, other_allele, beta, standard_error, p_value, N

> ⚠️ `variant_id` must be rsIDs. This pipeline is optimized for harmonized summary stats from the [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).

- Store your files in:
```bash
/genetic_correlations/data/sumstats/
```

#### 📝 b) Metadata File

Create a single file named `metadata.txt`, tab-separated, with the following columns:

| Column     | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `dataset`  | Short name for each dataset                      |
| `filename` | File name of the GWAS summary statistics file    |
| `N`        | Total sample size (use max if per-variant varies)|
| `cases`    | Number of cases (use `NA` for continuous traits) |
| `controls` | Number of controls (use `NA` for continuous traits)|

- Store the metadata file at:
 ```bash
/genetic_correlations/data/
```
**Note:** an example of 'metadata.txt' is included, which can be edited. Additionally, if the user wants to run the analysis across a subset of the GWAS datasets, it is possible to do so by creating a new metadata file including only those datasets (and specify the file name with the --metadata flag - see  ```run_nextflow.sh```).

#### 📦 c) LD Reference Files

1. **LD Scores for LDSC**  
 Download and extract:

 ```bash
 wget https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2
 tar -xvjf eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2
```

Place contents in:
 ```bash
/genetic_correlations/data/ld_reference/eur_w_ld_chr/
```

2. **1000 Genomes Reference or UK Biobank reference (for LAVA)**
Download European PLINK reference files as described in the LAVA reference guide or download UK Biobank reference files as described in the LAVA reference guide. Note that LAVA developers highly recommend to use the UK Biobank reference file.

Place 1000 Genomes Reference contents in:
 ```bash
/genetic_correlations/data/ld_reference/g1000_eur/
```
Place UK Biobank reference contents in:
 ```bash
/genetic_correlations/data/ld_reference/ukb_eur/
```
Note: The default LD reference file that is used is the UK Biobank, but the user can specify the LD source with the --lava_ref flag (options: 1KGP_EUR or UKB) - see ```run_nextflow.sh```).

### 4. 📦 LDSC Apptainer/Singularity Image

---

Download the LDSC container image from Zenodo:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15920751.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15920751)

```bash
# Download the image (1.2GB)
wget https://zenodo.org/records/15920751/files/ldsc_latest.sif
# Place it in the bin/ directory
mv ldsc_latest.sif bin/
```

### 5. ⚙️ Nextflow Configuration

---

The pipeline uses **relative paths** by default, making it portable across different systems. The configuration is set up for **Alliance Canada clusters** but can be adapted for other environments.

#### Minimal Configuration Required:

1. **For Alliance Canada users**, update the SLURM account:
```nextflow
process.clusterOptions = '--account=def-xxxxx'  // Replace with your allocation
```

2. **For other HPC/local systems**, you may need to:
- Change the `executor` from 'slurm' to your system (e.g., 'local', 'sge', 'pbs')
- Adjust resource allocations (memory, CPUs, time)

#### ⏱️ Time Considerations for LAVA:

The LAVA process is currently set to 6 hours, which works well for 2-3 datasets. However, **running time increases significantly** with more datasets due to pairwise comparisons:
- 3 datasets = 3 pairs
- 5 datasets = 10 pairs  
- 10 datasets = 45 pairs

To adjust the time limit, modify in `nextflow.config`:
```nextflow
withLabel: lava {
    time = "23h"  // Increase for larger analyses
}
```

#### Default Directory Structure:
The pipeline expects this structure relative to where your `main_full.nf` file is located.

## 🚀 Running the Pipeline

Once you've completed the setup and configuration, you can run the pipeline:

### For Alliance Canada/Béluga Users:

1. **Edit the SLURM script** (`run_nextflow.sh`):
   - Replace `def-xxxxx` with your compute allocation
   - Options in nextflow:
     
   | Option     | Description                                      |
   |------------|--------------------------------------------------|
   | --run_id   | Give the specific run a prefix (optional)        |
   | --metadata | Provide a different name to the metadata file    |
   |            | (optional - default: metadata.txt)               |
   | --lava-ref | Speficy LD reference for LAVA                    |
   |            | (optional; UKB or 1KGP_EUR - default: UKB)       |

2. **Submit the job**:
   ```bash
   sbatch run_nextflow.sh
   ```

### For Other HPC/Local Systems:

Run Nextflow directly:
```bash
nextflow run main_full.nf -profile <your_profile> -resume \
     --run_id analysis1 \
     --metadata ./data/metadata.txt \
     --lava_ref 'UKB'
```

The pipeline will:
- Process your GWAS summary statistics
- Calculate global genetic correlations using LDSC
- Calculate local genetic correlations using LAVA
- Output results to the `results/` directory
